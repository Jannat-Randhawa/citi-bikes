Citi Bikes Analysis Project New York. 

For this project I analyzed citiBikes data from 2013 to 2020. I chose 
2013, since it began in 2013 and chose it compare it to data from
2018, 2019 and 2020.  Though the data from 2020 was pretty minimal it was 
still pretty crucial to realize the impact of pandamic on bike sharing. 
The data collected was analyzed in terms of Age, Users and other variables. 

STORY NUMBER 1 

From the weekday analysis, it is pretty evident that bike sharing rates go 
up during the weekends especially on Friday and Saturday. When analyzing the 
busiest hours of the day 5pm seem to the hour with the maximum activity. 

From the analysis of the station id'd particularly the start station ID, 
stations close to central park seem to be the busiest. From our analysis 
from the top ten and bottom ten station ID, it can be inferred that the top 
10 station ID's are probably located in more accessible areas where as bottom 10 
are located in more remote areas. 

STORY NUMBER 2 

In the analysis of trip duration and user, it can be concluded that subscribers 
have a higher trip duration than customer across all 4 years. In terms of the Age 
Vs Trip analysis, in 2018 people around the age of 32 utilized bike share more than 
the other ages, however in 2019 people around the age of 17 travelled more by bike. 
In terms of the users, unknown gender customers seem to be the highest users of the bike
especially in 2013, where all bike customers are unknown. Male cutomers are higher than 
female customers, across all years 2013, 2018 and 2019. In terms of subscribers, male 
subscribers are almost higher than 70% for all the datasets. In terms of the average age 
of the subscribers and customers the average age of males and females is around 30 to 50. 
But strangely for unknown customers is around 45 to 50 for both subscribers and customers.
